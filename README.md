<p>I was scrolling through twitter over the summer and then i got bored and decided that i wanted to make my own twitter so i could test myself to see how far i could get in a few hours but mostly because i wanted to make sure that i retained my skills that i had acquired a while before. My intention was just to make a twitter clone with tweeting and feed update functionality so i could share it with my friends (this never happened because i never published until today) and we could technically send messages to each other via the live feed. When I setup all the files and had installed all the dependencies i figured i might as well have user authentication especially since i would want to be able to differentiate between who is sending what messages if i were to share this with my friends. For anyone viewing this that would like to test out the application, I would suggest not using any real information when you create your account because the app has no security measures whatsoever aside from firebase's own security, so just make some random account name with random password if you want or just login as the universal guest account. Also, if you create an account that account will be added to the list of accounts registered on the database so if you were to logout or login again you could actually use that email and password that you created the account with and it would log you back in.

I spent probably like 4-5 hours in total on this app in the span of like 24 hours... I could have probably done more with this like having a comment section, like counters, and added image/gif/video support for tweets to make things more interesting but I got busy with other things and this practice project got kind of thrown on the backburner and forgotten about since it really was just for practice after all and did not have any real world value like other projects may have.
